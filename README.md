# Student Performance Analysis: End-to-End ML with AWS & Azure Deployment

This project builds and deploys a machine learning model to predict student performance in math, reading, and writing using demographic and educational factors. It showcases an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment on both AWS and Azure cloud platforms.

## Project Goals

* Develop predictive models for student scores.
* Explore feature relationships and identify factors influencing performance.
* Deploy trained models as scalable web services on AWS and Azure.
* Demonstrate a complete ML lifecycle from data to deployment.

## Dataset

The dataset contains student information, including:

* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Parental Level of Education
* Lunch Type
* Test Preparation Course
* Math Score
* Reading Score
* Writing Score

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/PiusSunday/student-performance-analysis`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd student-performance-analysis`
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended): `conda create -n student-performance-analysis-venv -y`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    * macOS/Linux: `conda activate student-performance-analysis-venv`
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Explore the data and train the model using the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.
7. Follow the instructions in the `aws/` and `azure/` directories to deploy the model on your chosen cloud platform.

## Dependencies

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* Flask/FastAPI (for API deployment)

## Deployment

* **AWS:** coming soon...

* **Azure:** coming soon...
